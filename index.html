					<h2>2013 hackNY Fellow</h2>
					<p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve gotten a few emails asking for advice on applying to hackNY. Each time, I’ve rewritten my thoughts on the application process — gradually refining the emails. Over the weekend, I decided to consolidate those emails into one, get feedback from the hackNY community, and publish it for anyone interested in applying to hackNY &hellip;</p>

					<h1>Mike Swift<br></h1>
					<h2>2013 hackNY Fellow</h2>
					<p>Over the past few weeks, I’ve traveled to a number of schools to talk to student hackers about why they should apply for the hackNY summer fellowship program. The basic gist is that every summer hackNY supplies a group of up and coming student hackers with housing in the heart of NYC and pairs them up with a kickass paid intership at one of the city’s best startups &hellip;</p>

					<h1>Calvin Chan<br></h1>
					<h2>2014 hackNY Fellow</h2>
					<p>Recently, a lot of people have been asking me about New York. Sometimes, it's regarding this whole "hackingNY" thing that I was a part of this past summer. And other times, it's about my fascination with Manhattan and the greater NY area. But most of the time, the questions are just about how I manage to keep missing my flights out of Newark. But first, an anecdote. &hellip;</p>

					<h2>2014 hackNY Fellow</h2>
					<p>Quite a few people have asked to see my hackNY application. Instead of individually emailing it, I’ve decided to just post it here. Hopefully this is helpfully to anyone considering to apply to hackNY. Before submitting it I had it reviewed by multiple friends, both technical (for content) and non-technical (for spelling, grammar, flow, etc etc.) &hellip;</p>
